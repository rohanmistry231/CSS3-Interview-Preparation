/* Box with intentional issues for debugging */
.box {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightcoral;
    margin: 20px;
    padding: 10px;
    text-align: center;

    /* Intentional Issue 1: Negative margin causing overlap with the heading */
    margin-top: -40px;

    /* Intentional Issue 2: Line-height too small, causing text to overlap */
    line-height: 0.5;
}

/* Instructions for Debugging:
   1. Open Browser DevTools (F12 or Right-Click > Inspect).
   2. Select the .box element in the Elements tab.
   3. Check the computed styles for margin-top and line-height.
   4. Adjust margin-top to a positive value (e.g., 20px) to fix the overlap with the heading.
   5. Increase line-height (e.g., to 1.5) to make the text readable.
